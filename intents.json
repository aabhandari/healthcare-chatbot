For children to be included on a family policy, it’s important that guardianship be recognised by a Federal or State Government agency such as Medicare or one of the state-based family/community services agencies. We may ask for evidence of this guardianship.\nChildren are covered by your family policy until they turn 18 (or 25 if they are still studying full-time). If you have children aged 18 or over who aren’t studying, we encourage you to upgrade to our non-student dependant cover which covers them until they turn 25 regardless of their studying status.\n\nCouple\nA ‘Couple membership’ means a membership that includes two people − the policyholder and their partner. You don’t need to be married.\nIf you have any questions about cover for your partner and/or family, please contact our Member Care team on 1300 654 123 or email help@cbhs.com.au."],
